#Trying to construct a 6-chromatic UDG embedded in the circumsphere of the icosahedron

Here are CNFs related to the existence of the 5-coloring of graphs on 29112 and 54072 vertices, which we have not been able to solve so far. 

It seems more probable that the 5-coloring exists. However, we checked that after discarding a randomly chosen maximal independent set the remaining vertices cannot be colored in 4 colors.
