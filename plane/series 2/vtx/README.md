# Vertex coordinates in the Wolfram Mathematica format


The .vtx files contain lists of vertices. The coordinates are given in InputForm format (Wolfram Mathematica). The 'rotations' file contains expressions for complex numbers that define rotation angles. The files s2_M*.vtx contain the coordinates of the 73-element set M1 as well as the truncated Minkowski sums M2 = clip(M1+M1,1), M3 = M2+M1.

Since the expressions in the 'rotations' file do not have the simplest form possible, generating complete vertex lists takes quite a long time. At the moment the complete list is given only for the algebraically simplest case #10.
