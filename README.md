# Unit Distance Graphs and the Nelson-Hadwiger problem
This repository presents the results of the search for new examples of 5-chromatic unit distance draphs embedded in R^2 and S^2(r). 

These graphs are used to obtain lower estimates in the Hadwigerâ€“Nelson problem on the chromatic number of the plane and its generalizations, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadwiger-Nelson_problem

In the given .nb (Wolfram Mathematica) files we have checked the existence of 5-chromatic graphs of unit distances on circumspheres of the icosahedron and the great icosahedron with  unit edge lengths. An interactive visualization of the first of this graphs can be seen <a href="https://vsvor.github.io/">here</a>.

It seems probable that there exists an infinite number of such examples with different values of the radius. Besides, it is not excluded that for some values of the radius there exists 6-chromatic distance graphs.

The Sage 9.2 notebook implements an existence check of new examples of 5-chromatic distance graphs embedded in the plane.
