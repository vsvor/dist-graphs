# dist-graphs
Searching for 5-chromatic unit distance draphs embedded in the euclidean plane (R^2, C) and two-dimensional spheres S^2(r).

These graphs are used to obtain lower estimates in the Hadwigerâ€“Nelson problem on the chromatic number of the plane and its generalizations, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadwiger-Nelson_problem

Wolfram Mathematica files (.nb) implemented analytical verification of the existence of a 5-chromatic distant graph on 372 vertices embedded in the circumsphere of an icosahedron with a unit edge length, and a 5-chromatic graph on 972 vertices embedded in the circumsphere  of a great icosahedron.

It seems very probable that there exists an infinite number of such examples with different values of the radius. Besides, it is not excluded that for some values of the radius there exists 6-chromatic distance graphs.

The Sage 9.2 notebook implements an existence check of new examples of 5-chromatic distance graphs embedded in the plane.
