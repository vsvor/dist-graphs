# Unit Distance Graphs and the Nelson-Hadwiger problem
This repository presents the results of the search for new examples of 5-chromatic unit distance draphs embedded in R^2 and S^2(r). 


In the given .nb (Wolfram Mathematica) files we have checked the existence of 5-chromatic graphs of unit distances on circumspheres of the icosahedron and the great icosahedron with  unit edge lengths. An interactive visualization of the first of this graphs can be seen <a href="https://vsvor.github.io/">here</a>.
