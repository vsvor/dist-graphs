Searching for 5-chromatic unit distance draphs embedded in R^2 and S^2(r)


In the given .nb (Wolfram Mathematica) files the existence of 5-chromatic graphs of unit distances on described spheres of icosahedron and large icosahedron with a unit edge is checked. An interactive visualization of the first of them using three.js can be seen <a href="https://vsvor.github.io/">here</a>.
